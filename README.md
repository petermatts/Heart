# Heart

Just a little coding project I made for my girlfriend ❤️

## Running

Be sure to have python3 installed as well as the `turtle` and `pyinstaller` modules to build executable file which will be written to the ```/dist``` directory.

### Windows

```.\build.bat```

### MacOS

```./build.command```

### Product

After building the executable file should be in the `/dist` directory. 

WARNING: You won't be able to send the executable file over email, so you will need to either transfer the file with a flash drive or clone this repo and run the commands.
